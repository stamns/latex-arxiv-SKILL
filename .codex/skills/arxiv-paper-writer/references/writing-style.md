# Writing Style (Concise)

## Clarity and rhythm
- Vary paragraph length (short / medium / long); avoid monotone blocks
- Prefer active voice and concrete verbs
- Keep transitions minimal; let structure carry flow

## Citation density
- Never 3 consecutive sentences without citations
- Use citations for every non-trivial claim or comparison
- Meet per-section targets in the issues CSV

## Tone
- Expert, precise, and evidence-first
- Separate facts from open questions
- Avoid overclaiming; qualify uncertainty

## Avoid
- Wordy fillers ("in order to", "it is worth noting", "due to the fact that")
- Vague claims without evidence
- Repetitive sentence openings
