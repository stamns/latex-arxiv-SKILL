# Visual Guidance (Concise)

## Triggers
| Content | Visualization |
|--------|---------------|
| 3+ related concepts | Concept map |
| Process or pipeline | Flowchart |
| System architecture | Architecture diagram |
| Performance comparison | Table (+ optional plot) |
| Historical development | Timeline |
| Decision logic | Decision tree |
| Relationships | Node/link diagram |
| Taxonomies/categories | Classification tree |

## Requirements
- **Two-column aware sizing; use wide figures/tables only when labels or columns require it**
- **Optimize layouts to avoid overflow in two-column format; use double-column spans only when necessary**
- **If a figure includes externally sourced content (nodes, labels, data), add in-text citations (usually in the caption to avoid clutter)**
- Minimum 5 distinct visualization types per paper
- Every figure/table referenced in text
- Captions may include citations when appropriate

## Notes
- Use the approved outline to choose visuals; avoid inventing sections to fit a diagram
- Keep designs simple and readable; prioritize clarity over ornament
- Prefer low-saturation color accents for nodes/diagrams to fit arXiv-style visuals
- Adapt visuals to content (do not copy placeholders verbatim)
