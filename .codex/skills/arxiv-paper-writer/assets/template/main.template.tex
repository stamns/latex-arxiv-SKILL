%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% ABSTRACT
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{abstract}
[Your abstract should be a single paragraph (150-250 words) that summarizes your work. It should clearly state: 
(1) the problem addressed, 
(2) your approach/methodology, 
(3) key results, and 
(4) main conclusions or implications. 
Be specific and quantitative about your findings. Avoid citations in the abstract.]
\end{abstract}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% INTRODUCTION
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Introduction}
[The introduction should:
- Establish the context and importance of your work
- Clearly state the problem or research question
- Briefly review relevant prior work (with citations using \verb|\cite{key}|)
- Outline your approach and contributions
- Provide a roadmap for the rest of the paper

Example citation: Previous work \cite{author2023paper} has shown...]

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% BACKGROUND
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Background and Preliminaries}
[This section should:
- Define core terms and problem settings (with citations)
- Provide historical context (timeline is often useful)
- Clarify what is in-scope vs out-of-scope for this review
- Introduce the main families of approaches at a high level
- Use citations for all key claims \cite{smith2022deep}]

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% BUILDING BLOCKS / TAXONOMY
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Building Blocks}
[This section should:
- Break down the topic into reusable components (data, architectures, objectives, inference)
- Present a taxonomy and explain why it is useful
- Provide representative papers for each component/family
- Define all symbols if using equations
- Example mathematical equation placeholder (replace with a topic-relevant one):]

\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{(x,y) \sim \mathcal{D}} [L(f_\theta(x), y)]
\end{equation}

\subsection{Core Definitions}
[Define the key terms and assumptions used throughout the review]

\subsubsection{Notation and Assumptions}
[List symbols and core assumptions that will be reused across sections]

\subsubsection{Problem Variants}
[Call out common task variants or settings that affect comparability]

\subsection{Design Choices and Model Families}
[Describe the major model families and design tradeoffs; include citations for each category]

\subsubsection{Approach Families}
[Summarize the main approach families and representative examples]

\subsubsection{Design Tradeoffs}
[Explain the key tradeoffs (data, compute, latency, robustness, interpretability)]

\subsection{Implementation Notes (Optional)}
[If helpful, summarize common implementation patterns from the literature (e.g., training tricks, scaling behavior)]

- Include a timeline or table of major releases (with citations)]

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% EVALUATION
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Evaluation and Benchmarks}
[This section should:

- Summarize reproducible comparisons when available]

\subsection{Benchmarks and Metrics}
[List the main benchmarks and what they measure]

\subsubsection{Dataset and Task Coverage}
[Note where benchmarks cover or miss important settings]

\subsubsection{Metric Limitations}
[Discuss metric caveats and when alternative metrics are used]

\subsection{Failure Modes and Robustness}
[Discuss typical failure modes, bias, and robustness concerns supported by evidence]
