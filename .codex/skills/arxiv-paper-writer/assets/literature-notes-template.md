# Literature Notes: <paper topic>

This file is **optional**. Use it to keep a lightweight evidence trail for the papers you cite in `ref.bib`.
It helps prevent ``citation-only'' writing where claims drift away from what the cited work actually supports.

## Rules
- Keep each entry short (aim: 3--6 bullets).
- Every entry should answer: *what is the contribution* and *why are we citing it*.
- If a key claim is important, record the exact metric/dataset/setting.
- If the paper is not fully verifiable (paywall, missing PDF), mark **TODO** and do not rely on it for strong claims.
- If helpful, keep a very short abstract excerpt (1--3 sentences) to avoid re-searching.
