# LaTeX Agent `SKILL` (arXiv ML/AI Review Papers)

> [!NOTE]
> This repo implements a `.codex` `SKILL`: an end-to-end, issues-driven workflow that scaffolds an **IEEEtran two-column LaTeX project** for **ML/AI review articles on arXiv.org**, with **verified BibTeX citations**.
> Experimental Claude Code support is provided via `.claude` → `.codex`.

## What’s in here

- **End-to-end workflow**: issues-driven paper writing (plan → issues CSV → per-issue writing → QA/compile).
- **Primary `SKILL`**: `arxiv-paper-writer` at `.codex/skills/arxiv-paper-writer/SKILL.md`.
- **Helper scripts**: scaffolding, planning, validation, compilation under `.codex/skills/arxiv-paper-writer/scripts/`.
- **Example output**: a generated paper in `example/` (including `example/main.pdf`).

> [!NOTE]
> The workflow is inspired by “issue-driven development” as demonstrated by the [`appautomaton/agent-designer`](https://github.com/appautomaton/agent-designer) project.

## Quickstart (2 prompts → a compiled example paper)

The `example/` paper in this repo was generated by activating the `arxiv-paper-writer` `SKILL` with **two user prompts**.

### Prompt 1 (start the paper)

```text
write a review article for arxiv that is about SOTA generative image models
```

After this first prompt, the agent:
- does an initial literature pass,
- drafts a section framework,
- proposes a few candidate titles,
- and writes a `plan/<timestamp>-<slug>.md` file with clarification questions and a draft plan.

> [!TIP]
> Open the generated `plan/` markdown file and answer the clarification questions to steer scope, title, and coverage.

### Prompt 2 (delegate decisions and proceed)

```text
I will let you choose the best title and with the topics and inclusion of material that you see the best fit
```

In this example, the second prompt is intentionally vague (and the plan questions were ignored). The agent still makes best-effort choices and generates a complete LaTeX project that compiles to a PDF.

> [!NOTE]
> See the result in `example/main.tex`, `example/ref.bib`, and `example/main.pdf`.

## Environment notes

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A working LaTeX environment is required (e.g., `pdflatex` + `bibtex`, or `latexmk`).

- Tested on macOS with GPT-5.2 (Extra High).
